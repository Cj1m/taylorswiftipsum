A Taylor Swift lorem ipsum generator :scream:

This is a work in progress. Below is a running TODO list for me:
- ~~In `generateIpsum` remove the chosen word to remove the possibility of duplicate words~~
_Actually, should not be done because a user may wish to generate a number of words greater than the total number of unique words available_
- ~~In `highlightHashtags` we might want to add the tumblr hastag link (which would be super easy)~~
_Nah, this might be annoying for people when they try to copy the text_
- ~~Impliment a different way to get wordcount, possibly by number of spaces~~
- Refresh the Giphy loading gif on each submission
- In `addGrammar` add punctuation to the end of the last sentence
- In `addGrammar` we want the first letter of the hashtag to be uppercase if it's at the beginning of the sentence
- Refactor ajax / css
- Use SASS / Compass
- Experiment with rap genius fake apis
